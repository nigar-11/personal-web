        <h3>Design and Development</h3>
        <p>I started coding when I was 12 and since then I've been fascinated by this field. I have been learning new things ever since and do not plan on stopping any time soon. Over the time, I have gained knowledge about coding languages like LOGO, BASIC, JAVA, C, C++, PYTHON, HTML AND CSS.</p>

        <h3>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>The field of Computer Science that has intrigued me the most is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The thought that machines will work like humans and will even think and process commands like humans is a very interesting concept for me.</p>

        <img class="sec-pic" src="images/security.png" alt="Security">
        <h3>CyberSecurity</h3>
        <p>Another field of interest for me is CyberSecurity. Digitalization is a trending and huge change happening globally and with this change comes its risks. Ethical Hacking is a new way of preventing these risks and of ensuring online safety.</p>
